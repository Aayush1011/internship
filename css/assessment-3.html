    <p>The box-sizing property allows us to create an alternate box model. Normally, the box size doesn't include
        padding and border in the box's width and height. This makes it difficult to predict how a box will turn out
        from the one intended as the border and padding will be added separately to the width and height we have
        specified. To overcome this problem, the box sizing property allows us to assign value of border-box. This makes
        the box model include the padding and border in the overall width and height. This makes assigning style to
        elements more predictable and easier.</p>
